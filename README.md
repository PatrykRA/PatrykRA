<h1>ðŸ”ŽAbout Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm begginer application tester, ready for a exciting journey into the world of software testing. </p>
<p>I've just completed an intensive course in testing at GoIT Polska, where i gained solid foundations to start my career.</p>
<p>Additionally, I attended an IT school, where i have learned about SQL, CLI and basic of programming, significantly enriching my skill set.</p>
<p>Currently, I've set specific goals for myself: completing the final project in the course, finding a job as a tester, and passing the ISTQB exam. I'm know that enthusiasm alone won't achive these goals, so I'm prepared to work hard to acomplish them.</p>
